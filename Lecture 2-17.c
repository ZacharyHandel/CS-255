//We can rewrite what an operator does
    //This is called operator overloading

//What if we want to overload an output operator?
    //use a "friend class"
        //can access private and protected members of the other class in which it is declared as a friend.
    //"friend function"
        // can be given a special access to private and protected members. This should only be used sparingly.
        //Friendship is not mutual
