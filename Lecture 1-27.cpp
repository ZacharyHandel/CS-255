///ADD ONTO RECTANGLE PROJECT!!!!


//Multiple Files in One Project
//Things you need: Class Header (Ex: dayType.h), class implimentation file (dayType.cpp)
//the class implimentation must include the class header
//Main Driver (ex.main.cpp)
//Main Driver will also include class header
//When compiled, it will compile the class implimentation and the main driver into object code (Ex. main.o)
